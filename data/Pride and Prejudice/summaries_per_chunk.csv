    ""Napoleon"": ""Napoleon is a highly strategic and cunning character who is able to manipulate situations to his advantage. He is rarely seen in public, spending most of his time in the farmhouse, guarded by fierce-looking dogs. When he does appear, it is in a ceremonial manner, surrounded by an escort of six dogs. He is a stern and authoritative figure, often using fear to control the other animals. He is also deceptive, using Mr. Whymper to spread false information about the food situation on the farm. Napoleon is ruthless, ordering the execution of animals who are seen as traitors. He is also shown to be vain, awarding himself medals and having a portrait of himself painted."",

    ""Snowball"": ""Snowball is portrayed as a traitor and a menace to the farm, despite not being physically present. He is blamed for any misfortunes that occur on the farm, from stealing corn to breaking eggs. The animals are led to believe that Snowball is secretly visiting the farm at night to cause mischief. He is also accused of being in league with the human farmer, Mr. Frederick, and of plotting to attack Animal Farm. Despite these accusations, it is unclear whether Snowball is actually guilty of these actions or if they are fabrications by Napoleon to consolidate his own power.""
